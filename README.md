- 👋 Hi, I’m @acs48
- 👀 I’m a chemical engineer with passion for programming. Mainly working  on model predictive automation and control.
- 🌱 I’m a Golang enthusiast since I discovered it.
- 💞️ I’m extensive user of commercial software. But it is often simpler and more effective to build my own solution rather than fighting to adapt or make some other software work.
